(Note I'm going to delete later) I'm currently trying to learn as much as I can about networking. Currently I only really know how to do networking using replication in UE5 and a bit in Unity with plugins. So I don't know a ton and I'm hoping to start with something easy and then make 1 or 2 harder demos once I've learned more.

1. Project Objectives
	The goal of my project is to cleanly network a variety of common systems and mechanics. There would be no gameplay but instead a large demo area that shows each mechanic working as expected in a multiplayer setting. Or a selection of different levels that each showcase a different solution to a problem. These could include syncing physics based interactions, compensating for latency in a shooter, inventory/crafting/resource gathering, asymmetric gameplay, or turn-based gameplay. This project would be significant for me because it shows I have a deep understanding of Unreal Engine’s replication and how to create a variety of gameplay systems & mechanics with it.

2. Tools and Technologies
Unreal Engine 5: I’m using Unreal Engine 5 because at the moment I am most comfortable with using it for networking and it is a large platform for game development. It will also allow me to quickly create polished products without having to build them from the ground up.
C++: For better performance and flexibility I will be using C++ in areas where I believe it is needed.
3D Assets from Unreal Marketplace: I’ll be using assets from the marketplace just to make the demos nice to experience.

3. Scope
	I’m hoping to make 3 or 4 small levels that have some built in way to display the networking work when played alone and include simulated latency. I would hope to finish this project within 3 to 4 weeks hopefully making 1 level per a week. The only constraints I could anticipate is making a system for a single person to experience the networking work alone. Hopefully I’ll find some technique to solve this issue.  

4. Deliverables
	At the end of this project there will be a playable demo and a short video showcase of each level. Each video will showcase only the most important parts and the problems I run into and solutions I used.
